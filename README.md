# ProjectHappiness_WebWithoutCompression
A text quest in a rare genre of plot comedy with a fair amount of absurd humor and spicy notes of philosophy. Just a few references â€“ I couldn't come up with any more there was no room for more.
You wake up and there's not a soul around. What's happening? What is the project "Happiness"? In search of answers you will go through dangerous adventures. Your choices are very important, but they can have unpredictable consequences.
58 endings with hints to get them and a short description of what happened for those already received.

Everything for your convenience
An image scaling system implemented from scratch that allows the game to work on any screen resolution and aspect ratio, displaying everything it sneeds. The only elements not taken into account are those on the display (such as cameras) and non-rectangular displays.
Possibility of key binding for keyboards and gamepads.
The interface was designed from scratch to reduce the number of clicks.
Saves and autosaves (with the ability to disable them). The game is saved when closed - if you accidentally closed it, you don't have to worry.
Full support for Russian and English (British) languages, as well as an interface in Arabic, Chinese traditional, English (American), Hebrew and Hindi.
Bright colors in the menu and calm in the game itself - to reduce the strain on your eyes.
Option to disable the gradual appearance of text on the screen.
