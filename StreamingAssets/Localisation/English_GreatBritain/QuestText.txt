hint1;Hint 1: If the text starts with "-", it means the main character is speaking out loud.
hint2;Hint 2: If the text begins with quotation marks, then these are the thoughts of the main character.
1;Russia, nameless village. A story about an ordinary Russian guy.
2;You wake up. Head is buzzing, as if you were hit with a sledgehammer.
3;Twice.
4;Yesterday was your friend's birthday.
5;"Yes, we had a good rest yesterday."
6;The body is heavy, it’s hard to even move a finger.
7;After a couple of minutes, you finally started to come to your senses and were able to open your eyes.
8;There's not a cloud in the sky. There is no wind. No sound (except the buzzing in the head).
9;"Strange. Something is not right. Need to get up."
10;"Strange. Something is not right. Need to get up.": Stand up sharply
11;Get up
12;Rise carefully and slowly
13;Having come to your senses, you decided to look around.
14;There is a ditch to your right. There was a bottle filled with some kind of liquid.
16;Drink the contents?: Yes
17;The bottle contained a mixture of alcohol and ditch water.
18;Your body could not withstand such a test of strength and you gave up the ghost.
19;No
20;"Surely this is water from a ditch or some kind of swill that can make you blind."
21;"Need to see what's going on in the village. I'll go there".
22;Silence. All houses are closed.
23;"Where has everyone gone?"
24;"Oh yes, today there is a wedding in another village and everyone is there. So I'm the only one here."
25;You noticed a flying saucer standing in the middle of the road.
26;"Where did it come from?"
27;Going around it, you didn't find anything.
28;Except for some small lightnings surrounding the device.
29;"Maybe something like a force field? Come on..."
30;You are trying to touch a flying saucer. Surprisingly, you manage to do it.
31;So, there is no field. Well, I didn't really want it!
32;Inside the flying saucer it turned out to be somehow...empty.
33;A transparent canister with a clear blue liquid, about two-thirds full.
34;Colored holograms of buttons - red and green.
35;There was nothing else.
36;Drink from a canister
37;"It smells like donkey urine."
38;"But it tastes good."
39;You put the canister back. It's now about a third full.
40;Finish the liquid
41;"The samurai go all the way!"
42;As soon as you emptied the canister, you began to experience severe gas formation.
43;It became too difficult to contain it.
44;There was a huge explosion that did not leave an atom even from a flying saucer.
45;This led to the emergence of an exclusion zone.
46;Press the red button
47;The flying saucer exploded. Apparently, it was a self-destruct button.
48;Press the green button
49;The canister was emptied. Through the porthole you can see that the saucer has stopped between the Earth and the Moon.
50;Without a spacesuit you can't breathe. The buttons are blocked.
51;You felt a little jolt.
52;"Are these instead of massage chairs? A useless thing."
53;You spat on the green button. And then decided  inspect the device at last.
54;A lot of liquid has disappeared in the canister. Twenty to thirty percent left.
55;After leaving the saucer, you found yourself in some large city.
56;Almost every building had its own architectural style.
57;You noticed that next to you was the inscription "Parking", made in many languages.
58;The streets were empty.
59;Suddenly, a voice rang in your head.
60;Voice: Welcome!
61;"So i'm hallucinating that strong. What we consumed yesterday really was alcohol?"
62;Voice: You are not hallucinating. You found yourself in a city on the Moon.
63;"I heard that if you give in to hallucinations, they will pass faster."
64;- Where is the toilet?
65;Voice: Every resident has his own house. It also has a toilet.
66;"Ha, and you call yourselves aliens? But in our village everything around us is a toilet!"
67;Voice: No one prevents you from doing so in your home.
68;- Do you have to pay taxes on the Moon?
69;Voice: No.
70;"Truly a Paradise."
71;- Where are the aliens? Did I get there in vain?
72;Voice: Due to the high development of alien life, residents usually do not leave their homes.
73;"Ah, I get it. My neighbor is like this. He also constantly screams that some unskillfully dudes got him."
74;Keep silent
75;Voice: Frankly, you shouldn't be here.
76;"Just like you in my head! Get out!"
77;Voice: Was the flying saucer really empty?
78;"No, there was a canister there. And the buttons."
79;Voice: Very strange. Then we need to figure out what happened. You will be given a card.
80;Voice: And you are prohibited from transmitting it without permission. And yes, in the canister was fuel!
81;With these words, you found yourself in a room similar to a bedroom.
82;"Eh, we didn't finish! Which card? Do you need another SIM card on the Moon?"
83;A creature appeared out of nowhere in the room.
84;With eyes and face it resembled the Grays from science fiction, but was completely white.
85;And he's also a three-meter tall jock.
86;"Oh, here comes the coolest guy in the area. And there's nowhere to run."
87;Jock: Welcome to city our! Name my is Kh'arg. On the situation I'll brief you.
88;The jock spoke so fast that you couldn't get a word in.
89;Kh'arg: The flying saucer you shouldn't have found.
90;Kh'arg: We are already looking into the situation and to Earth a squad has been sent.
91;Kh'arg: As soon as clears up everything, back you will be sent.
92;Kh'arg: We have already studied memories your. Apparently, something to the pilots happened.
93;Kh'arg: In your room A lot of things are blocked, because not a resident of the city you are.
94;Kh'arg: But it is not forbidden to use you are used to objects.
95;The jock disappeared as suddenly as he appeared.
96;"He will bring up to date. I still don't understand anything!"
97;"It's like I'm back at the university. It seems like they are explaining something, but it doesn’t get any easier."
98;Suddenly you find yourself in a different place again. However, nothing new.
99;The room resembled a dining room. Unfamiliar characters were sitting in front of you.
100;The first one looked like a man with a metal head.
101;The second one is an enormous double-headed purple cat with a spiked tail.
102;The third looked like an ordinary man-a brunette about one meter twenty centimeters tall.
103;- Where am I again? And who are you? I'm not tasty!
104;Cat: You're at the resistance headquarters. It's hard for you right now, but I'll try to clarify the situation.
105;- Talking cat!
106;Cat: (ignoring your remark) We are the guardians of this city. But there's a lot we don't like.
107;Cat: First of all, only creatures that will die in a year or less get here.
108;Cat: Alien technology allows to track even this throughout the universe.
109;Cat: Such creatures are kidnapped and truly heavenly living conditions are created for them.
110;Cat: All your wishes will be fulfilled. Actually all. Technologies allow.
111;Cat: But on the day of death, the residents disappear somewhere. And they don't appear anymore.
112;Cat: We want to find out what's really going on.
113;Cat: And this is where you come in handy. You shouldn't have come to this city.
114;Cat: You're not in the tracking system. You won't die in the next year.
115;Cat: In addition, the guards who flew to Earth on a saucer have disappeared. That's how you got here.
116;Cat: There won't be another chance like this!
117;Cat: It's time to get acquainted. Our names are unlikely to tell you anything, so nicknames will suffice.
118;Cat: I am the Leader.
119;Leader: This is (points at the robot) Quick-sighted. He's a cyborg. His eyes see the invisible.
120;Leader: And this is (points to the brunette) Gnome.
121;Gnome: You're a Gnome yourself! (Whispering) Well at least not a dwarf.
122;- Dwarves are cooler.
123;Gnome opened his mouth to object, but the Leader delicately coughed each head and continued.
124;Leader: And what's your name?
125;- Let it be a Guest. Where did you even get the idea that I want to help you?
126;Leader: Are you really thinking of leaving alive? Helping us is the only way.
127;- I'm all ears.
128;Leader: Let's go to the knowledge repository first. It's a kind of library.
129;Leader: Surely there is some kind of secret level there. But first you need a weapon, just in case.
130;Leader: Hold a blaster and gauntlet shield. The shield is activated by pressing a button on the index finger.
131;You find yourself in an unknown place again. It really looked like a library.
132;Only in addition to books there were also disks, some cubes and various devices.
133;Leader: The repository is very high, so I'm sure we need to go underground.
134;You decided to take a book with a beautiful gold binding.
135;And again found yourself in an unknown place.
136;- How long will this last?
137;The place was a small empty dark room without windows or doors.
138;Voice: You have been transported to the correctional floor of the Repository. It is strictly forbidden to take exhibits!
139;- You again! And anyway, what kind of library is this where you can’t take anything?
140;There was no answer.
141;Sit down to meditate
142;After many hours of meditation, you learned Zen and were reborn as an elf prince in another world.
143;Spit furiously on the floor
144;Due to the peculiarities of the material, the spit ricocheted with incredible speed and pierced your skull.
145;Kick the wall
146;Due to the peculiarities of the material, the blow returned to you a hundredfold and you were torn into pieces.
147;Get stuck in the phone
148;The brightness of the phone has been adjusted for outdoor use on a sunny day.
149;In a dark room, you went blind, and your heart could not stand such a test.
150;Shoot a wall with a blaster
151;Cut your finger and pray to Cthulhu
152;Out of nowhere, tentacles appeared and broke through one of the walls.
153;Then Cthulhu wrapped a Band-Aid around your finger wound and gave you cookies with tea.
154;Cthulhu: Nothing personal, I just hate aliens.
155;Cthulhu: I'll go eat sectarians, so next without me.
156;The beam from the blaster ricocheted and headed towards you.
157;Wait for what happens
158;The beam incinerated you.
159;Evade
161;The beam continued to ricochet and you had to dodge further.: Keep dodging
162;After a while you get tired.
163;Shoot at the wall ahead of time
164;Turn on the shield
166;The beam continued to ricochet, but you were safe as the shield surrounded your body.: Wait
167;After a while the shield charge ran out.
168;Strike a cool pose
170;When two lasers meet, an explosion occurs. Like in cartoons.
171;There was a hole in one of the walls now.
172;It was relatively light outside. The ceiling flickered red.
173;There were walls on the left and right edges. All that remained was to go forward.
174;Go forward
175;Wait for the guide
176;After a while the guards arrived and incinerated you from blasters.
177;Complain to mom
178;Unfortunately, there is no connection.
179;Google the route to Earth
180;Unfortunately, there is no internet connection.
181;For a while you walked only along the walls.
182;Then noticed a room ahead, and there the aliens were playing backgammon.
184;Judging by the blasters on the transparent table, these are guards. And you were noticed.: Try to destroy them
185;The guards reacted faster than you could take the blaster.
186;One of them pressed some button on the table and you were flattened by a hammer blow from above.
187;Show the chicken dance
188;The guards silently waited for you to stop dancing, after which they incinerated you with a blaster.
189;Throw a blaster at a guard's face
190;The guard threw his own in response, piercing your skull.
191;- Can you tell me where the exit is?
192;- I'm a little lost.
193;The guards pointed to the passage behind them and continued the game.
194;Join
195;"And how to play backgammon?"
196;You thought it looked like "Chapaev", so you shot the chip.
197;The guard disagreed and incinerated you with a blaster.
198;Salute
199;- May I report?
200;The guards gestured to you "Shoo-shoo" and you went further down the corridor.
201;- Corn, churchkhela, pasties
202;The guards quickly lost interest in you and continued the game.
203;You walked further down the corridor, continuing to repeat the saving phrase.
204;- You can go, I'll replace you
205;The guards quickly packed their things and disappeared.
206;You waited a bit and went further down the corridor.
207;- Shall we dance?
208;The guards did not appreciate your offer and incinerated you with a blaster.
209;After some time wandering through the corridors, you came across a room.
210;There were 4 things in it that looked like portals from science fiction.
211;Orange, green, polka dots and triangle.
212;You can't see anything behind them.
214;Which portal to enter?: Orange
215;Green
216;Polka dots
217;Triangle
218;You find yourself in another room with a lot of vats of molten metal.
219;From the opposite end of the room there was a conveyor, which turned not far from you.
220;And then he gradually climbed up, straight to the only passage here.
221;Mechanical hand periodically picked up items from the conveyor and dumped them into vats.
222;Scoop it out of the vat and drink it
223;To your surprise, the liquid turned out to be too hot and tasteless.
224;Take a bath in a tub
225;You loved going to the bathhouse, so at first it was not even bad.
226;But then suddenly it got hotter and hotter and you didn't have time to get out.
227;Lie down on the conveyor
228;The hand took you by the scruff of the neck and lowered you into the vat.
229;Jump on the hand
230;The hand swung back and on the way back threw you into the passage.
231;Running up the conveyor
232;You have reached the passage safely.
233;Mechanical hands distributed items from the conveyor along different paths.
234;You calmly drove to the end and found yourself on a small platform.
235;There was something like a control panel in front of you.
237;Far below, a black portal was visible. But how to get there?: Jump
238;You fell to your death.
239;Running up, jump straight down
240;You really got straight into the portal! It's good that it dampens the speed.
241;Cannonballed
242;Your pieces are scattered all over the site.
243;Activate the shield and jump
244;You have successfully landed and entered the portal.
245;Press the up arrow
246;A mechanical hand appeared out of nowhere, took you by the scruff of the neck and placed you in front of the portal.
247;"Should have brought extra pants with me. I reached the portal, but at what cost?"
248;Press the down arrow
249;The platform began to descend like an elevator. You have safely reached the portal.
250;You found yourself in the midst of a "sea" of greenery. But white.
251;The green sun was shining overhead in the yellow sky.
252;On the left was a plant similar to a sunflower, but large and constantly changing color.
253;Behind the flower was a wall. There was also a wall on the right.
254;Ahead is a purple stream, on the other side of which a black portal can be seen. And behind it is a wall.
255;Approach the plant
256;When you came closer, at first appeared the sunflower's eyes...
257;Then - a mouth full of sharp teeth.
258;That was the last thing you saw.
259;Shoot the plant with a blaster
260;To your surprise, the plant evaded.
261;Activate the shield and approach the plant
262;Approach the stream
263;Burn the plant with a blaster
264;You found some kind of passage under the plant.
265;Enter the passage
266;You went straight to the black portal.
267;Get away out of harm's way
268;Pet the flower
269;The flower showed a huge tongue with which it licked your shield.
270;Then he began to rub against you and make sounds similar to purring.
271;When he had played enough, something similar to a hand appeared from under the ground.
272;It shot you straight into the portal.
273;Eat a seed
274;When interacting with saliva, the seed produced a strong explosion.
275;Eat a petal
276;"Tastes like fried potatoes."
277;The world around began to shimmer with all possible colors.
278;Ahead you noticed a dancing big-eyed house with unicorns running on the roof.
279;Three-headed pink bearded sharks were walking around the house.
280;Some of them were riding huge purple chickens.
281;You found a pie in your pocket and decided to eat it.
282;Have a drink
283;The liquid turned out to be an acid that quickly increases in volume when interacting with saliva.
284;On the other hand, you began to quickly decrease in volume.
285;Cross the stream
286;The liquid turned out to be an acid, quickly shrinking you, starting from your feet.
287;Soon there is not even an atom left of you.
288;Activate the shield and cross the stream
289;You made it to the other side and entered the portal.
290;You found yourself sitting at a table in a small room and tied to a chair so that you couldn't move.
291;There was a mechanical tentacle in front of you.
292;Voice in the head: Welcome to the dining room!
293;"What kind of food is this that a person needs to be tied up? And when did you manage to do this?"
294;Voice: This is for your own convenience. The tentacle feeds you with a spoon, and you rest.
295;"And why tie??"
296;Voice: To make sure that you eat. The chair, due to the supply of impulses, allows to control your mouth.
297;A menu appeared in front of my eyes.
299;"Which soup to choose?": Warming
300;Cooling
301;Fish
302;Color changing
303;Poisonous
304;Explosive
305;Swelling up
306;Luxurious
307;Invigorating
308;Infinite
309;Voice: Usually you need to eat a special pill before it, but since you insist.
310;Voice: Magma soup with stones flavored with ash.
311;"Too warming!"
312;Voice: Usually it is eaten in extreme heat, but as you wish.
313;Voice: This soup is served at absolute zero temperature.
314;Voice: Soup with fishes with strong scales and devouring you from the inside.
315;"I should be the one eating the soup, not it eating me.!"
316;Voice: This is a favorite delicacy of races with strong insides.
317;Voice: This is the only way they can scratch themselves from the inside.
318;Voice: The main thing is not to chew the fish, otherwise you will break your teeth.
319;"Broken teeth are the least of the problems!"
320;Voice: Soup with lots of spiritualistic herbs.
321;The dish changed its color every moment.
322;"Is this really edible?"
323;Voice: Certainly.
324;The dish turned out to taste unusual. After all, the taste also changed every moment!
325;When you were completely fed soup, it began to seem to you that something was wrong.
326;But what?
327;The fact that the world around has become dazzle with all possible colors?
328;Or that the mechanical tentacle was constantly changing shape?
329;Spaghetti, a school of fish, someone's hand, a mushroom, countless other shapes.
330;Or the fact that instead of a table, you saw different creatures every moment?
331;Turtle, cat, bear, motorcycle, many others.
332;Voice: Rhinos run on caterpillars backwards .
333;"Excuse me, what?"
334;Voice: Cattish sunflowers smoking meatballs after volcano rain on Tuesday.
335;"Does cycling pizza run or do push-ups on Wednesdays after breakfast?"
336;Voice: In fact, pours lemonade on car sprouts.
337;The world gradually began to return to its normal state.
338;"Good soup and interesting side effects."
339;Voice: A favorite treat for races with immunity to poison.
340;Voice: Many creatures are interested in eating something that can kill. Even you people, for example, have puffer fish.
341;The soup contained several poisons.
342;Paralyzing. Causing sometimes fever and sometimes chills. Causing weakness.
343;Causing hallucinations. Convulsive.
344;"Praise Odin that the cook forgot to put the deadly poison. Or is that how it was intended?
345;Voice: The main ingredient is “grenade” meatballs, simulating explosions inside the body.
346;Voice: They periodically emit a characteristic sound and shoot compressed air.
347;Voice: Due to this, it seems to you that you are exploding from the inside.
348;The soup turned out to be quite tasty.
349;But would you like to repeat these feelings?
350;Voice: Inside the body, the soup begins to increase in size.
351;Voice: Ideal for hiking and the army.
352;Unfortunately, the soup grew in size too quickly.
353;Voice: Few people survived after this soup. It's too delicious!
354;You only managed to eat one spoonful and your heart stopped.
355;Voice: The perfect breakfast if you haven't fully woken up yet.
356;Voice: The main ingredient is electric algae.
357;Voice: You will be electrocuted with every bite.
358;The current turned out to be non-lethal, so with difficulty, but the soup was defeated.
359;You will never forget this taste!
360;To your surprise the portion size was normal. The taste is not bad.
361;"And why infinite?"
362;After a while the tentacle stopped.
363;"What's the matter? I want more!"
364;Voice: You've already had enough.
365;You notice that the amount of soup in the bowl has not changed.
366;"Well, at least a little more! Oh please!"
367;The tentacle fed you for a while, but then you felt that you were no longer chained.
368;And began to devour the soup greedily. Even though you had already eaten too much, you wanted more and more.
369;"Just how does it fit in?"
370;And nothing were changing on the plate.
371;You felt that you were no longer tied to the chair.
372;A black portal appeared ahead, to which you headed without much hesitation.
373;You find yourself in front of a pyramid similar to the Egyptian one, but smooth, without blocks.
374;In front of the entrance there was a sign with the inscription "Portal inside" in many languages.
375;Enter the pyramid
376;Go in the opposite direction
377;The desert didn't want to end. Unlike your energy.
378;It seemed to you that the sand and the scorching sun would dream of you in nightmares even in the next world.
379;But you fed several hyenas.
380;Climb the pyramid
381;"Who knows, maybe the portal is at the very top?"
382;After several hours of unsuccessful attempts, you fell exhausted.
383;Go around the pyramid
384;"The portal is probably at the very end of the pyramid".
385;Once on the opposite side, you melted a hole in the wall with a blaster and went inside.
386;Your guess turned out to be correct - there was a portal here!
387;Digging under
388;You successfully created a path with a blaster, then made a hole in the pyramid.
389;And ended up in a room with a portal! Not wanting to push your luck even further, you entered it.
390;After walking down the corridor for a while, you came across a room.
391;It was filled with giant spider eggs. At the end there was a passage further.
392;But next to him was a giant spider. He was probably asleep, since he didn't notice you.
393;Cook scrambled eggs
394;The spider did not appreciate your culinary skills and decided to demonstrate his own.
395;To begin with, he spat acid at you and let it brew thoroughly.
396;Then bit into several pieces, salted, peppered and decorated the dish with cobwebs.
397;Posted the photo on the Internet and only then ate it.
398;Jump while whistling
399;The spider woke up and watched you for a long time, but then couldn’t resist and asked
400;Spider: Are you really that stupid?
401;Go slink
402;You successfully reached the opening and showed the spider your tongue.
403;Kick the spider
404;The spider woke up and for a long time could not believe your impudence.
405;Shoot the spider
406;Kick any egg
407;The kick caused a chain reaction, which caused all the spiders to hatch.
408;The spider woke up and wrapped you in a cocoon, and then fed you to the spiders.
409;The next room after wandering through the corridors turned out to be a bar.
410;The mummy bartender stood with his back to you and prepared drinks.
411;Behind the counter sat a crocodile, an enormous scarab and an alien.
412;At the end of the room there was a passage further.
413;Sneak past
414;You have reached the goal without any problems.
415;- Is there anything free?
416;Bartender: Unfortunately, no.
417;- Did I go then?
418;Bartender: Yes. Did you think a crocodile would eat you?
419;Keep silent and look away
420;- Of course not.
421;- It’s clear from him that he’s well-mannered and smart.
422;The crocodile blushed and embarrassedly bit off your head.
423;- This is a bar of cool dudes, isn't it?
424;Alien: Well, yes.
425;- Then what are you doing here?
426;- So I'm at the right place.
427;- Hey, bartender!
428;The whole group turned on you.
429;- Bet I can wipe the floors with you?
430;Bartender: Finally a man with a sense of humor?
431;Bartender: Here you go, on the house.
432;He put down a glass of greenish liquid.
433;- And what is it?
434;Bartender: Uranium vodka. This is the bomb, bro, try it.
435;Crocodile: Yes, your life won't be the same anymore.
436;Drink
437;- Uranium? No, thanks.
438;Bartender: Eh, you're disappointing. Well, at least a sip, eh?
439;- Ok, I'm sold.
440;- No means no!
441;Bartender: Мне больше достанется.
442;The mummy drank the liquid in one gulp, after which it shuddered.
443;Bartender: Uh, good! Go where you were going.
444;Instead of a bar, an alien battle broke out in front of your eyes. They shot each other with flowers.
445;After being hit, fireworks appeared, each spark of which then exploded.
446;Every second the battle location, weapons, surrounding and colors changed.
447;There were cats riding on rockets and trees with mushrooms instead of leaves.
448;Crocodile: Well, I told you, you can't give so much to beginners! He doesn't hear anything.
449;Scarab: But definitely our man! Look how he hallucinates.
450;Alien: Should have at least given the cesium wine to start with.
451;Mummy: Let's take him to the portal to make him even more crazy.
452;Alien: Ha, great idea.
453;After the hallucinations stopped, for a while you still saw everything in green.
454;"Portal! But I was at the bar..."
455;"Oh no! Anyway..."
456;It seemed like an eternity before you finally found the room with the portal.
457;You find yourself in a small room, somewhat resembling a knowledge repository.
458;On the opposite side of the entrance there was a familiar black portal.
459;"There is clearly something hidden here, since it is so hard to get here. Need to dig through everything."
460;"This time it will also teleport, when will I pick up the book?"
461;Closing your eyes, you cautiously picked up the first book you came across.
462;When you open your eyes, you don't notice any changes around you.
463;After hours of searching, you haven't found anything. Except one data cube.
464;Project "Happiness".
465;With the development of technology, people, in theory, should be happier and happier.
466;But in few places this happens.
467;There are very few happy residents. Especially if you consider the whole life, and not just a moment.
468;But the happier the resident, the less likely he is to commit a crime.
469;If healthy, of course.
470;The goal of the project is to try to make residents happy.
471;Every day, not just once.
472;Take creatures that have only a year left to live as “test subjects”.
473;And deliver them to the test complex, in one of which the reader is currently located.
474;If you fulfill all the wishes of the residents, create all the conditions for them, will they be happy?
475;Or will they get used to it and take it as a new reality?
476;Or maybe all this does not affect the level of happiness at all?
477;If the project will be successful, the lives of all sentient beings can be changed for the better.
478;After all, the methods worked out in the complexes can be implemented in real cities.
479;"Eh, the date is missing. Perhaps it's worth taking this cube".
480;You went to the portal.
481;A group was waiting for you in the vault.
482;Leader: Well, finally! Where have you been?
483;- I escaped from prison, by the way! You can't touch books.
484;Leader: Oh, yes, we didn't issue you a pass. This is awkward.
485;- It doesn't matter anymore, I dug up something. What about you?
486;The Leader only spread his paws in response.
487;You find yourself back in the room that looks like the dining room where it all started.
488;Leader: I think there's really a clue in that data cube.
489;Leader: It’s strange to put such an emphasis on happiness.
490;Leader: Not to cure diseases, not to increase life expectancy.
491;Leader: Not to reduce the stratification of society. You can list a lot of things.
492;Leader: Now we need to find out where the residents are disappearing to.
493;Guest: Maybe they'll be teleported back?
494;Leader: What is the point? After all, they disappear on the day of death.
495;Guest: But how can a person die if all conditions are created for him here?
496;Gnome: I heard something about it being Fate. It does not matter where the resident is and in what condition.
497;Gnome: Even if he is healthy and sitting at home. On the day of death he is destined to die.
498;Gnome: His heart may stop. There may be a brain hemorrhage.
499;Gnome: The knife can slip out and cut a vein. There are many options, especially outside the home.
500;Guest: But you're saying that residents are disappearing, not dying. Are they being taken somewhere? For what?
501;Leader: That's what we want to know. We need to get to where data about residents is stored.
502;Leader: That way we can find out who's going to die soon.
503;Leader: And then we'll see where they disappear. But there is one problem.
504;Leader: We don't have access to this building.
505;Leader: And before going to the repository, we had no idea where the information was stored.
506;- Isn't there a back door?
507;Quick-sighted: Yes, but there was only a mention of it in the records.
508;Leader: The plan is - I'm too big and conspicuous, so I'm staying here.
509;Leader: And you all go on a mission. Quick-sighted will find out where the back door is, then you will figure it out.
510;Leader: Besides, I have more important things to do - I need to lick myself.
511;Quick-sighted: The goal in the Distribution System of Residents.
512;- Wait, aren't there cameras and security systems there? Are we just going to go?
513;Leader: There may be security systems, but there are definitely no cameras outside.
514;Leader: Residents are sitting at home, what's the point?
515;After several tens of minutes of walking around and around the building, Quick-sighted stopped.
516;Quick-sighted: I found a passage, but it needs to be activated. Buttons are invisible.
517;Quick-sighted scurried back and forth for a while, making passes with his hands, after which the passage in the wall opened.
518;You find yourself in a room that looks like an office.
519;- Quick-sighted, do you see any passages?
520;Quick-sighted: Not yet. Apparently, something needs to be done to move on.
521;- Why is the office so, uh, human? Where are the technologies of the future?
522;Quick-sighted: How should I know?
523;Gnome: Maybe it's made for people.
524;Press the pen cap
525;A powerful explosion occurred.
526;View records
527;Half an hour later you got to the last piece of paper.
528;There was very little text on it - “Whoever reads it will die”.
529;"I'm wasting my time here, and they're inserting memes!"
530;Suddenly your heart stopped.
531;Turn on the TV
532;Sit on a chair
533;The mechanism abruptly lifted the chair to the ceiling and you were flattened.
534;Turn on the computer
535;The computer hummed so loudly that the sound wave tore your internal organs.
536;Open the closet
537;A  skeleton was sitting in the closet.
538;Skeleton: This is an assault on private property! You have no right!
539;And incinerated you with a blaster.
540;You started getting sucked into the TV. A second later you were already in a different place.
541;Quick-sighted: Have we been teleported?
542;- You'll get used to it.
543;You found yourself in a small room. A large fan could be seen ahead, blocking the passage.
544;Gnome: Should I turn it off?
545;Quick-sighted: Let's save this option for last.
546;- Why don't destroy it with a blaster?
547;Quick-sighted: Because you can see from the fan that it is made of reflective material. It's useless.
548;- I...just checked that you know too. And if you turn on the shield?
549;Quick-sighted: You'll be spinning endlessly in the fan and you won't be able to move.
550;There was a large button on the wall next to the fan. There was a rocket launcher next to you. And behind there is a lever.
551;There was some kind of hole in the ceiling.
552;Click on the button
553;The walls instantly shrank and you were crushed.
554;Fire a rocket launcher
555;After the explosion the fan stopped.
556;Gnome: Now that is what i call covert penetration.
557;Gnome, your time has come
558;Gnome went to the fan.
559;- Wait, what are you doing? He'll cut you down!
560;Quick-sighted: He will have time to jump between the screws. At least he should.
561;- This is madness!
562;You watched with bated breath as Gnome stopped by the fan.
563;And then he jumped forward horizontally.
564;After a while, the fan stopped.
565;Switch the lever
566;You ended up in the previous room.
567;Gnome: It’s interesting how the movement works here.
568;You turned on the TV again and found yourself in a room with a fan.
569;- Shall we climb over the top?
570;Gnome: Then I'll climb. Who knows what will be there.
571;- And what can you do that we can't?
572;Gnome: Maybe get through? I'm the smallest.
573;You climbed on Quick-sighted, and Gnome climbed on you.
574;Gnome: Damn, too high. Придётся прыгать.
575;- You kidd...
576;By some miracle your structure survived the jump.
577;After a while, the fan stopped.
578;There was a door behind the fan. And behind it is a large room with a bunch of holograms, like in the movies.
579;Gnome: Looks like we're here.
580;Gnome and Quick-sighted began to search for the necessary data.
581;Gnome: Bingo! I found a man. He will die the day after tomorrow. He is eighty-two years old. Race - human.
582;Gnome: I wrote down where he lives.
583;- So simple? No alarms or anything? Why is it even empty here?
584;Quick-sighted: Data is automatically sent to those responsible for missing residents.
585;Quick-sighted: The control room is needed just in case.
586;You find yourself in the dining room again.
587;Leader: Excellent work, comrades! Gnome, Guest, go to the future victim.
588;Leader: Quick-sighted and I don't really look like people, so we can't.
589;Gnome: As a guard, they will have to let me in. No big deal.
590;- What's the plan anyway?
591;Leader: You will need to install cameras that are invisible to the eye throughout the house.
592;Leader: This is how we find out if someone is taking the residents.
593;Leader: If teleports are used, the cameras won't help us.
594;Leader: Therefore, a tracking device is required.
595;- And where do we attach it?
596;Leader: It's a tiny drone. You take it with you, and I will handle it.
597;Leader: I'll fly through the nose and land somewhere in the lung area. So the drone will definitely survive.
598;We were standing in front of an ordinary-looking house.
599;Gnome: Well, here we are. You distract him by talking, and I'll do everything..
600;- It's not fair!
601;Gnome: Do you know how to attach cameras? Unnoticed.
602;- So teach me!
603;Gnome: There is no time. What if we're already late?
604;He rang the doorbell.
605;It was really an old man who opened the door, except a too cheerful one.
606;And not to say that the day after tomorrow he will be gone.
607;Everything went great.
608;The day after tomorrow. It was decided to monitor the cameras in pairs to not to miss anything.
609;Finally, someone appeared in the house and disappeared along with the resident.
610;Gnome: All rise! It's started!
611;Leader: I knew that if they take away residents, it will be with the help of teleports!
612;Gnome: What about the tracking device?
613;Leader: I'll take a look now, while you check the recording and find out who it was.
614;Gnome: This is Kh'arg!
615;Leader: So whoever meets also sees off.
616;Leader: They are at the very top of the knowledge repository. You can't get there without access.
617;- So what now? We are convinced that something is wrong. But there is no permission.
618;Leader: I think I've come up with a plan. But you won't like it.
619;Leader: We will change the date of death of one of us to the next few days..
620;Leader: With the help of some devices we will be able to experience everything together with him.
621;Leader: This is how we will find out what happens to the residents after the teleport.
622;Leader: We need to make sure that something is wrong here. Maybe they're just being sent home..
623;Quick-sighted: Let me.
624;- Why not me? After all, i'm the most useless.
625;Leader: You definitely can't. You weren't supposed to be here at all.
626;Leader: And we wouldn't have succeeded without you.
627;Leader: And we have been ready for the worst case scenario for a long time.
628;Leader: Besides, Kh'arg knows that you got here by mistake and will immediately suspect something is wrong.
629;Gnome: And why not me?
630;Leader: Because you won't be noticed.
631;Gnome took a deep breath.
632;- And why don't you?
633;Leader: I have little paws.
634;We have successfully changed Quick-sighted's death date to the day after tomorrow.
635;Before that day, he swallowed something like a pill, and we all connected to special devices.
636;Thanks to this, we could live a Quick-sighted life with him, feeling the same as he did.
637;The day after tomorrow Kh'arg appeared before Quick-sighted. They immediately teleported to the top floor of the repository.
638;Kh'arg immediately disappeared.
639;A white, half-transparent man appeared in front of Quick-sighted.
640;He held out his hand and you felt the Quick-sighted begin to lose strength.
641;The man screamed, fell to his knees and began coughing and choking.
642;Another person came to the sounds, also white and transparent.
643;The second transparent: Rackford! What happened?
644;Rackford: Velgem, you know...that I have... allergy... on the life force.
645;Velgem looked at Quick-sighted.
646;Velgem: You are a guard, why are you here? Changed your death date! Do you see what this has led to?
647;Velgem: Well, okay. Calm down, just calm down. What do you want to keep quiet?
648;Quick-sighted: I want to know the truth. About everything that happens here. And in other complexes.
649;Quick-sighted: About you two and about the project "Happiness". In general, about everything.
650;Velgem: Don't you want too much? You are in my power. Suppose I tell you, what will you do then?
651;Quick-sighted: Depends on what I hear.
652;Rackford has already stopped coughing and choking.
653;Velgem: It's even funny. All right, have it your way. There's nothing you can do to me anyway.
654;Velgem: We are representatives of one of the oldest races. Even its name has been forgotten.
655;Velgem: Our race is capable of accumulating energy indefinitely and converting it into magic.
656;Velgem: As soon as the space runs out, the energy begins to shrink and can be accumulated further.
657;Velgem: Our race can live forever. Is there a catch? I don’t know, although I’ve been looking for an answer for a long time.
658;Velgem: We were born about a billion years ago. We were neighbours, played together and became friends.
659;Velgem: At twenty-five, Rackford went on a business trip to a distant planet.
660;Velgem: And there he caught something. An incurable disease that drains his strength.
661;Velgem: The only way to keep him alive was to be able to provide access to energy.
662;Velgem: At the same time, he is allergic to vital energy.
663;Velgem: And his body does not assimilate other types. And what remains?
664;Velgem: His body could last a few more years and I was trying to find the right kind of energy.
665;Velgem: One day I thought - what if I let him suck out a creature that is dying?
666;Velgem: After all, then there will be a minimum of vital energy and allergies should not work.
667;Velgem: And so it turned out. And the energy was absorbed by the body!
668;Velgem: And then I noticed that the effectiveness varies greatly from case to case.
669;Velgem: So what's the matter? It turned out that the biggest influence was how happy the creature was.
670;Velgem: That's how the idea of complexes arose.
671;Velgem: Thanks to the magic and technology of printing anything, people are happy here!
672;Velgem: The project is working and some countries have already even partially implemented it for law-abiding citizens.
673;Quick-sighted: You kidnap creatures against their will! It's wrong!
674;Velgem: By no means. First of all, I always ask, does a creature want all its desires fulfilled?
675;Velgem: Want to live for own pleasure and not depend on anyone?
676;Quick-sighted: But no one will say "No" to such questions.	.
677;Velgem: Well why? Suspicious ones will ask everything. Some even refuse. What's wrong?
678;Quick-sighted: People don't know they're going to die in a year. And what do they sign up for.
679;Velgem: Right. But how could they live happily knowing that they were going to die soon? The answer is obvious.
680;Quick-sighted: Why don't you let the creatures come back?
681;Velgem: There were no willings yet.
682;Quick-sighted: Why should I even trust you?
683;Velgem: You shouldn't. But why would I lie?
684;Quick-sighted: Where do the residents disappear to? Well, the the energy will be sucked out of them, but the bodies must remain.
685;Velgem: We can completely absorb creatures, splitting them into energy. Not even an atom remains.
686;Quick-sighted: What's the point of guards if you already have so much energy?
687;Velgem: It's simple. First of all, I also need sleep and rest. And the complex will not be without protection at this time.
688;Velgem: Secondly, I can't keep track of everything at once. Thirdly, I am alone, but there are many complexes.
689;Quick-sighted: How much longer are you going to kill creatures to prolong Rackford's life?
690;Velgem: Until I make the medicine. And generally speaking...
691;Velgem: I don't kill creatures! I don't absorb energy by whole galaxies, although I could!
692;Velgem: That way I would have accumulated the right amount long ago. But this is wrong.
693;Velgem: Sucking out creatures that are about to die is the best option. It's not hurting anyone..
694;Quick-sighted: And when will you make the medicine? And anyway, wouldn't one complex be enough?
695;Velgem: It's complicated. About eight hundred million years ago I was in one of the distant worlds.
696;Velgem: There I came across a curious island. No one has been sick on it for a long time. There was no crime.
697;Velgem: No wars or even fights. It turned out that local magicians had come up with a very complicated spell.
698;Velgem: It allows you to change reality itself, removing aggression, disease, hatred, and so on.
699;Velgem: But their strength was only enough for the island. And it took a lot of sacrifices.
700;Velgem: I want to reproduce this spell for the whole universe, and this requires a lot of energy..
701;Quick-sighted: How do I know you don't want to destroy the universe?
702;Velgem: I could have destroyed it four hundred million years ago, I had enough energy.
703;Velgem: But creation requires significantly higher costs.
704;Velgem: And this is the only way I know to heal a friend.
705;Quick-sighted: But why can't you just cast a spell on him?
706;Velgem: The spell has one peculiarity - it only works in the homeland. And you shouldn't leave it.
707;Velgem: Our homeworld was destroyed long ago as a result of a collision with another planet.
708;Velgem: And if the spell works on the whole universe, then everyone will be in their homeland..
709;Velgem: After all, we were all born and live in the universe!
710;Quick-sighted: And what if it doesn't work?
711;Velgem: It will work, I have calculated everything a long time ago.
712;Quick-sighted: Each race considered many things impossible until it developed its own level of technology.
713;Velgem: I have thoroughly studied that island and this spell. Everything will work out.
714;Velgem: But it will take at least another five hundred million years, taking into account the expansion of the universe.
715;Quick-sighted: Diseases are natural and cannot be eliminated! No one can predict how this will affect!
716;Velgem: That's nonsense. All the oldest races are sufficiently developed and have cures for all diseases.
717;Velgem: So what's the difference - being able to cure all diseases or destroy them forever?
718;Velgem: And nothing bad ever happened to that island. I'm keeping a close eye on it.
719;Quick-sighted: Why don't you absorb solar energy? The energy of wind, tides, and so on?
720;Quick-sighted: The one that goes nowhere.
721;Velgem: The spell requires energy received from creatures. How can I explain...
722;Velgem: Roughly speaking, it has a different composition. That's why the magicians needed a sacrifice.
723;Quick-sighted: You're talking about magic. What does it mean?
724;Velgem: It's almost like in books and movies. Few have access to magic, our race is one of the few.
725;Velgem: But it's better in practice, right? Now I'll absorb some solar energy.
726;Velgem disappeared and returned after a while.
727;He created a fireball the size of half a room, then lightning, then a tree.
728;For a while, he soared into the air and flew.
729;Velgem: Well, is that enough? Will you keep silent?
730;Quick-sighted: So many things. It's hard to say, need to think about it. And if I tell someone, then what?
731;Velgem: Do you mean someone else besides your friends who are watching you?
732;Quick-sighted stunned.
733;Velgem: I don't recommend it.
734;Velgem: If you do not keep your word, I will erase the memory of you and everyone you tell.
735;Quick-sighted: So you're not going to kill or suck out?
736;Velgem: Of course not.
737;Quick-sighted: Okay, then I'll...go?
738;Velgem: I hope you will do the right thing.
739;Quick-sighted teleported to you.
740;Quick-sighted: And what are we going to do? It's not that bad. Even though I don't like it.
741;- Wait. What about those two guards who got me here?
742;Leader: They wanted to live on Earth. Therefore, no longer guards.
743;- Can't they tell everyone about this place?
744;Leader: I think Velgem will make sure they don't do that.
745;Gnome: So what's the plan?
746;Leader: None yet. Everything turned out to be more complicated than I thought.
747;- They need to be stopped
748;- We need to tell the world the truth
749;- I'll stay here
750;- I'm flying home
751;- I will help Velgem
752;Leader: How? You've seen what Velgem is capable of.
753;- If we change the date of death for one of us, Rockford will not be able to move due to allergies.
754;- And we can destroy it! Only Velgem will remain.
755;Gnome: Just the strongest, big deal.
756;Leader: It's not even that he's the strongest. Many questions remain.
757;Leader: What if they are immortal? And that's why they can live forever?
758;Leader: What will Velgem do after the death of a friend?
759;Leader: He has been accumulating energy for it for a billion years. Could destroy the universe.
760;- I don't think he's going to do that. So will accumulate energy for the spell..
761;Leader: I wouldn't be so sure. Okay, let's assume. Rackford destroyed. How to defeat Velgem?
762;Leader: And what if he calls the rest of the guards to destroy us? Are we going to kill them too?
763;Leader: Besides, you're already proposing to kill them instead of stopping them. It's a completely different story.
764;- Because the only chance to stop them is to kill. I don't think they can go to jail.
765;- I don’t know how to kill Velgem. I don't know what to do if he calls the guards. They are innocent.
766;Gnome: What if we take Rackford hostage?
767;Quick-sighted: And what's next?
768;Velgem: Yes, and what's next?
769;We simultaneously turned towards the sound.
770;Velgem: You can't stop me. But you are really capable of harming Rackford.
771;Velgem: And I won't let that happen. Therefore, I will erase your memory of this conversation and you will start it again.
772;Velgem: No longer thinking about killing Rackford.
773;- There is something like a social network, but on a universe scale?
774;Leader: Generally speaking, everything is not so simple, but there is. What do you propose to post?
775;- Everything we know
776;- How powerful is Velgem. How exactly he want to heal Rackford. And how he kidnaps creatures.
777;Suddenly Velgem appeared in front of us.
778;Velgem: I won't let you do this.
779;- What, are you afraid of the truth, Mr. Universe?
780;Velgem: If you tell the whole truth, everyone will know how much energy I have already absorbed.
781;Velgem: I'll be hunted down to be used as a weapon.
782;Velgem: And Rackford - as a hostage, so that I obey.
783;Velgem: You have no idea how powerful and dangerous creatures exist.
784;Velgem: Moreover, this way I will never cure Rackford, because energy will be spent on the needs of the owners.
785;Velgem: I will erase your memory and you will return to the discussion.
786;Velgem: Without even thinking about posting data online.
787;- All about Rackford's disease
788;- But let's not talk about Velgem. Because it is unlikely that he will allow such a thing to be posted.
789;Quick-sighted: Ha, that's for sure.
790;You couldn't even imagine what this would lead to.
791;Scientists from all over the universe are interested in Rackford's disease. No medications helped.
792;What interested everyone most was that life could only be sustained by the energy of happiness.
793;After decades of hard work, scientists have learned how to synthesize the energy of happiness.
794;And then created many mechanisms that allow to convert different types of energy into happiness.
795;Thanks to this, Rackford was always healthy. And Velgem was able to accumulate energy for a spell much faster.
796;Velgem was recognized as the hero of the Universe. He insisted on recognizing your entire group as heroes as well.
797;Many streets and universities have been named after you.
798;But there was also a downside. What can be created can also be destroyed.
799;Authorities around the world have used this energy as incentive to enforce absurd laws..
800;And in case of problems, happiness was taken away from the residents.
801;Criminals have learned to use it as a drug.
802;- We've been through a lot together. Who knows, maybe I'll still be useful.
803;- Just let them create conditions for me, as for all residents. And so on until the very end of life.
804;- In exchange for my silence.
805;Leader: Great plan! I think Velgem won't mind.
806;- And so that they don’t come for me anymore
807;- I've already been here, haven't I? You can't get here twice.
808;- And I shouldn't.
809;- And erase my memory
810;Fly away
811;Just fly away
812;You lived on Earth. From time to time missed your friends from the Moon.
813;And a year before death came here again.
814;You were happy to meet your friends, but the joy was overshadowed by the knowledge of what lies ahead.
815;Just wait to die
816;Let Welgem suck you out
817;- Let's not muck about. What's the point of waiting for your fate for a whole year?
818;- Suck out my energy now and get it over with.
819;Velgem: You're doing the right thing.
820;- I want to forget all this. What I learned is too difficult for the ordinary person.
821;Leader: I understand. Even though you forget it, know that you are not an ordinary person.
822;- Farewell, friends.
823;Leader: Farewell, friend.
824;Gnome: Know that you will always be in our hearts.
825;Quick-sighted couldn't find what to say.
826;You lived the rest of your life on Earth.
827;You lived the rest of your life on Earth, periodically recalling your adventures.
828;You lived on Earth.
829;And a year before death came here again.
830;As an ordinary resident.
831;Velgem: I appreciate it. It's true. Thank you.
832;Velgem: I never thought before that there could be volunteers. It's a great idea!
833;Velgem: The sooner I can cast the spell, the more creatures I can save.
834;Now Velgem was looking all over the universe for volunteers.
835;People who have no meaning in life. Terminally ill.
836;People who live in terrible conditions. Or constant suffering.
837;Some of them agreed. To those who refused, he simply erased the memory of the conversation.
838;Thanks to this, the spell was cast two hundred million years earlier.
839;Velgem has been recognized as a hero of the universe. Monuments were erected to him in all corners of the world.
840;Many streets and universities were named after him.
841;But also in honor of you. Velgem spoke about your feat and insisted that you too be recognized as a hero.
842;Leader: In what sense?
843;- I think his goal is worth the sacrifice. Voluntary, of course. And I want to become one of them.
844;- I'll let him suck my life out.
845;Quick-sighted: For what? You still have to live!
846;- With the energy of happiness alone, he will accumulate energy for a long time. I want to speed up the process.
