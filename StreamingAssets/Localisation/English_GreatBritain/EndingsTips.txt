Haste makes waste
Not slow enough
Don't give up pleasure
See it through
How to resist it?
Do not see it through
Need to think
A bad habit will not lead to anything good
Release emotions
Mom told you to use it less!
Predictable result
Keep going
You are inimitable!
How he can be here?
One against all
Remember your childhood
It's a pity you don't have a glove
Don't stay away
Do you really think they'll agree?
Hotter than boiling water that you like
You were saying that like it hotter
Blend in with your surroundings
Too far away
You're not in the pool
Appearances are deceptive
Usually this is fried first
Wake up the gourmet in yourself
Usually this is boiled first
The depth should be checked first
How not to freeze
It's kind of hot
You've eaten this so many times, what could go wrong?
Not from cola with mentos
An offer that cannot be refused
This can't be! Have to take it.
A smart one won't go uphill, a smart one will turn around
You can see better from there
Not the best place for a snack
Enjoy life
He's lying down here, how dare
Make his sleep eternal
I want to cause a fuss
Silence is golden
Nobody likes a show-off
Click
Maybe there's a clue there?
Take a rest
Maybe a passage opens through it?
Maybe there's a lever inside?
Maybe it will stop?
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Don't want to break up
Knowing the end in advance is too hard
Don't have the strength to wait for the inevitable
Usual life
Our paths diverge
As if nothing had happened
You need to trust
